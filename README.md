# Scrap-Detection

The Scrap Detection and Rate Estimation project is a Python application that leverages the power of the OpenCV library to detect and estimate rates of scrap objects in images or video streams. This project finds practical applications in industries such as manufacturing, quality control, and waste management, where automated detection and estimation of scrap materials are crucial for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Using OpenCV's computer vision capabilities, the project employs advanced image processing techniques to identify scrap objects within a given image or video feed. The application uses techniques like edge detection, contour analysis, and color thresholding to segment and isolate the scrap objects from the background.

Once the scrap objects are detected, the project utilizes machine learning algorithms to estimate the rates associated with the scrap materials. These rates could include metrics such as the area occupied by the scrap objects, weight, volume, or any other relevant parameters for quantifying the extent of scrap.

The Python project provides a user-friendly interface where users can input images or video files and receive real-time feedback on the scrap detection and rate estimation. The results can be displayed visually, or users can access the data in a structured format for further analysis and reporting.

Overall, the Scrap Detection and Rate Estimation project offers a robust solution for automating the detection and estimation of scrap materials, saving time and resources in various industries while improving productivity and quality control measures.
